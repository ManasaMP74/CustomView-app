- In this app I've tried to cover all the custom view creation for view and view controller
- I've embedded custom view's in ViewController through programatically or in storyboard
- Try to use one of the way for creating custom view. Use programatically creating or xib or storyboard
- If your using xib with class name added to view, then call xib load method only in `override init` method. 
- If your using xib with class name added to view, then call xib load method in `override init(frame: CGRect)` and `override init(code: NSCoder)`  method.
